//! Regression: the first *cold* `open_or_build` on a fresh project must return a
//! built graph synchronously — not `None`.
//!
//! `open_best_effort` kicks off a one-shot background graph build the first time
//! a project is opened cold. If `open_or_build` went through that path, the
//! background build would acquire the `graph-idx` lock and the synchronous
//! `load_or_build` fallback would then contend on the same lock and return an
//! empty index, so the very first `ctx_graph` / `export_graph_html` on a fresh
//! repo failed with "No graph available" until a retry (#695/#682.2).
//!
//! Current `open_or_build` opens via `open_existing` (which never triggers the
//! background build) and only then builds synchronously, so the race cannot
//! happen. This is an integration test on purpose: the library is compiled
//! without `cfg!(test)`, so the background-build path that is skipped under unit
//! `cfg!(test)` actually exists in this binary and the guarantee is real.
